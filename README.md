# piwigo-export
Creates a folder structure from a Piwigo album hierarchy

Had enough of Piwigo (which is probably great, but not for my family). Data exports as a number of zip files, one of which includes a database dump. This script reads from the database and sorts photos into a folder structure corresponding to Piwigo albums.
